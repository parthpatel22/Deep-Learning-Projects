# Deep Learning Projects
Assigment 1: Create a Linear Regression model which optimizes MSE cost function and weight optmization 

Assignmet 2: Create a similar model which optimizes MSE cost function but uses Stochastic Gradient Descent to find optimal weights and does hyperparamter tuning

Assigment 3: Create a Logistic Regression Model which classifies image dataset using Stochastic Gradient Descent and hyperparameter tuning

Assigment 4: Create a n layered neural network with k neurons to classify image dataset using Stochastic Gradient Descent and hyperparameter tuning (including optimal n and k)
